### dimentionNum : an arbitrary size for the dimensions, can set to have a diffent value. 
### cardNum: the number of cards to form a set. here is a const 3.
### cardsdeck: the total numbers of cards (collection), can set to have a  diffent value.
### a card has four dimensions, color,number,shape,shading, and each demention has 'dimentionNum' possible values. 
### here I use an array of ["1","2","3",....,"dimentionNum"] to represent a set of all possible values of a dimention.
